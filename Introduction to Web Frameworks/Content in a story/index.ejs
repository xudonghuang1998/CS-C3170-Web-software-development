<h1>Story time!</h1>

<p>
    Waking up, <%= name %> felt <%= emotion %>. <%= name %> had spent most of the previous evening with friends, and recalled that they were writing an application. <%= name %> had an inkling that the application had something to do with brainwaves, but simply could not recall what. The feeling, being <%= emotion %>, must have had something to do with the application.
