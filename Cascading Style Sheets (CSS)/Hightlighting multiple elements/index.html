<h1>A small village!</h1>
<p>Once upon a time there was a small village. The village had many <span class="highlight">fishermen</span>. The weird part of the village was that there was <span class="highlight">no</span> water anywhere closeby.</p>
<p>That didn't bother the fishermen though, as they fished from <span class="highlight">rainy clouds</span>. As we all know, rainy clouds contain fish -- why else would there be water in the clouds?</p>
